# Example Uses
These are just a few of the ways you could use 5e Downtime Tracking to keep track of various things in your game! Use this as inspiration, or do something totally new and different.

## Train Thieves Tools Proficiency
Let's say your ranger saw the rogue pick a lock and thought that was cool. Now she wants to train to be able to do that, too. Try a setup like this:
- Type: Ability Score (Dex)
- Completion Target: 300

Have your player roll to progress this activity each day they use their downtime to practice. A good rough guideline is that it takes an average person about a month of work (I believe the 5e DMG says 4 weeks) to become proficient in a task if they spend 8 hours a day performing it. The average person will roll a 10 on this check. 30 days x 10 = 300 target. Players who have good Dex will naturally do better on this check than others on average, thus making the training time a little quicker for them.

## Kill 10 Rats
The RPG classic! With Simple progression mode, this one's a snap:
- Type: Simple
- Completion Target: 10

Every time your player kills a rat, have them roll to progress the activity, and it'll increase the count by one.

## Make Friends With The Locals
Let's say your BBEG has arrived in the town he'd like to build his super cool world-ending death machine in, but before he can do that, he's gotta make everyone in town like him. He's a pretty charismatic guy, he's got the help of his minions, and your timeline estimates he can do this in about two weeks. Support for awesome modules like About Time is coming soon, but in the meantime, you can use something like this to get it done:
- Type: Simple
- Completion Target: 14

Roll to progress the activity each time a new day begins, and it'll increase the progress count by one. 14 days later, it'll hit completion.

## Skill Challenge: Make Friends With The Locals PC Edition
Your PC's have arrived in town, and something is amiss. There's a super cool world-ending death machine being constructed in the middle of town, but the locals won't say anything about it. Collectively, the party has to convince the town to let them in on its weird little not-so-secret secret before it's too late. This one's a group effort, and it'll take everyone to help out. So you set up a skill challenge. Once a day, each member of the group can contribute to the task by making some kind of skill check and explaining how they're using it to win over the townsfolk. This is where things get fun with the module:
- Create an actor to serve as a "Group Task Holder". This doesn't really represent any particular person, but we're going to use it to keep track of large activities that the whole group is involved in, since it doesn't really belong on any individual's sheet. You might want to give your group the ability to view this sheet, so they can see how progress is coming along.
- Create a new downtime activity on your Group Task Holder to represent this skill challenge.
- Set the type to Simple
- Set the completion target to 100 (or any other number you see fit)

Do the skill challenge as normal. Each time a player makes a check, use the quick adjustment field to increase the progression by the amount the player rolled on their skill check. A group of five PC's who all roll really well could reach the completion target in a day, but it's more likely that this will be a 2-3 day affair. Either way, now you have a super simple way to keep track of how they're doing.
